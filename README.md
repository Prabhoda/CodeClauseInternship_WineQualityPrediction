# CodeClauseInternship_WineQualityPrediction
Wine quality prediction is a task that uses machine learning to assess and forecast the quality of wines based on their chemical properties. It can help wine enthusiasts and producers make informed choices about the wines they buy or produce.

Some of the chemical properties that affect the quality of wine are:

Fixed acidity: The amount of non-volatile acids in wine, such as tartaric, malic, and citric acids.
Volatile acidity: The amount of gaseous acids in wine, such as acetic acid.
Residual sugar: The amount of sugar left after fermentation.
Citric acid: A weak organic acid that is found in citrus fruits and adds freshness to wine.
Chlorides: The amount of salt in wine, which can influence the taste and stability of wine.
Free sulfur dioxide: A preservative that prevents oxidation and microbial spoilage of wine.
Total sulfur dioxide: The total amount of free and bound sulfur dioxide in wine, which can affect the aroma and color of wine.
pH: A measure of the acidity or alkalinity of wine, which can affect the flavor and stability of wine.
Density: The ratio of the mass of wine to its volume, which can indicate the alcohol content and sweetness of wine.
Sulphates: A compound that can enhance the flavor and preservation of wine, but also cause headaches and allergic reactions in some people.
Alcohol: The percentage of ethanol in wine, which can affect the body and flavor of wine.
